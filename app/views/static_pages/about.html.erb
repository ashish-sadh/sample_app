I am Ashish Sadh, developer of InterVilla.com. Primary goal of this website is to help students hassle-free application procedure for short-term stint as intern at corporate organisations and universities. There are very less intern opportunities available in a particular organisation, but this number goes fairly high, should we take greater number of organizations into account. Therefore, students often require to apply and repeat the same application process more than once and sometimes they put off in mid-way after few rejections, which has nothing to do with their academic credentials, but most of the positions got already filled before their applications could reach on the table across.
