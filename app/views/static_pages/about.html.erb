 Hi,
<br>
I am Ashish Sadh, developer of InterVilla.com. Primary goal of this website is to help students hassle-free application procedure for short-term stint as intern at corporate organisations and universities. There are very less intern opportunities available in a particular organisation, but this number goes fairly high, should we take greater number of organizations into account. Therefore, students often require to apply and repeat the same application process more than once and sometimes they put off in mid-way after few rejections, which has nothing to do with their academic credentials, but most of the positions got already filled before their applicationcould reach on the table across.
<br>
What we plan to offer:
<br>
1) Common application platform.
<br>
2) Intern portal where organizations can post their intern requirements.
<br>
3) Applying to more than one place will never be such a tiring process.
<br>
Thanks
<br>
